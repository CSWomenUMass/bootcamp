# Tech Skills Bootcamp

## Before you start

If you do not have access to a linux system, we strongly recommend using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in conjunction with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

Note that if you're on Ubuntu Linux already and you want to try this Vagrant thing out, you're going to want to get the on from the website and not the one from ``apt-get``, as it is [out of date and not compatible with most images](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash/issues/322).

## Fork this repository!

Fork this repository, and clone your copy once you're inside vagrant.

    git clone git@github.com:${GITHUB_USER_NAME}/tech-skills-bootcamp.git 

## Add your username to the participants file!

Open the file for editing with ``nano``. If you're familiar with ``vim`` or ``emacs`` we've installed those for you, too. ``nano`` is very simple to use, though.

    nano participants.md
