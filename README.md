# Getting Started

If you do not have access to a linux system, we strongly recommend using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in conjunction with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

Note that if you're on Ubuntu Linux already and you want to try this Vagrant thing out, you're going to want to get the on from the website and not the one from ``apt-get``, as it is [out of date and not compatible with most images](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash/issues/322).
