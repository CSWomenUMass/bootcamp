# Getting Started

If you do not have access to a linux system, we strongly recommend using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in conjunction with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). 

Working in a VM also has the advantage that you can try crazy things with less penalty ``rm -rf /`` means you'll only lose the VM itself, and not the ability to boot your computer!
